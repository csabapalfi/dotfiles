# .chrome

This folder just contains some user scripts that can be dragged to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

Most of this only works/tested in latest/recent Chrome versions.

Would be nice to just get something like [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs) working but that's no longer active.
