# .chrome

This folder just contains some user scripts that can be dragged to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

No care is taken to support older/other browsers and as much ES6 is used as possible.

Would be nice to just get something like [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs) working but that's no longer active.
